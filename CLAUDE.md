## Maintenance Tasks

### Immediate Actions (Public Repos - CRITICAL)
1. **Add LICENSE files** to: OpenAI_DeepResearch, agentic-planner-cli, DatGen, text-featurizer, nlp-preprocessing-tools, notebooks_Jupyter
2. **Add repository topics** to all public repos for discoverability
3. **Write basic READMEs** for: DatGen, text-featurizer, nlp-preprocessing-tools

### Immediate Actions (Private Repos)
1. **agentic-planner-cli**: Review and handle `demo.cast` file
2. **GM-RKB**: Review and commit validator session notes

### Recommended Actions
1. **Archive low-value public repos**: Consider archiving DatGen, text-featurizer, nlp-preprocessing-tools if not maintaining
2. **Focus investment** on high-potential repos: llm-judge, OpenAI_DeepResearch, agentic-planner-cli
3. Consider initializing git for Ancalagon_annotation_analysis if needed
4. Consider initializing git for mediawiki-mcp-server if needed
5. Regular spring cleaning using GM-RKB's improved spring_clean.py

## Integration Points

- **GM-RKB** ecosystem: Core system with infrastructure and site components
- **Testing Pipeline**: llm-judge provides testing capabilities for other projects
- **Session Management**: Shared patterns between agent-music and CCB
- **Documentation Standards**: Consistent use of CLAUDE.md across projects

## Next Steps

1. Commit pending changes in flagged repositories
2. Continue active development on session management features
3. Maintain CI/CD pipeline health across all projects
4. Regular documentation updates as features evolve
