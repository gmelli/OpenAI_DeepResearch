# OpenAI Dev Team Meeting Preparation
**Date**: 2025-01-21
**Role**: VP of AI, LegalOnTech.com
**Domain**: Contract Tech (AI-first)

## Key Discussion Topics

### 1. API Reliability & Enterprise Readiness
- SLA commitments for legal/compliance use cases
- High availability requirements for contract processing

- Handling nested conditionals and complex legal language
- Multi-modal processing (tables, signatures, exhibits)
- Hallucination prevention in legal context

### 6. Workflow Integration
- Real-time negotiation support and redlining
- Streaming capabilities for interactive drafting
- Assistants API for autonomous contract review agents
